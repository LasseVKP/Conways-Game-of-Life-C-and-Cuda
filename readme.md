# Conway's Game of Life made in C and CUDA

This repository is part of a project where the speed of CUDA cores are compared to CPU cores using Conway's Game of Life.

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a zero-player game where a cells are born and will perish based on simple rules about the neighbouring cells.

The graphical parts of the program is made using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) (Thank you [raysan5](https://github.com/raysan5/))
